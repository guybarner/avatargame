        Zuko is a firebending master, born as a prince in the Fire Nation Royal Family,
        <br />
        <br />
        who reigned as Fire Lord from 100 AG until his abdication in 167 AG.
        <br />
        <br />
        Originally the primary enemy of Team Avatar,
        <br />
        <br />
        Zuko devoted three years to trying to capture the long-lost Avatar to end his banishment and regain his honor as Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.
        <br />
        <br />
        He is recognizable by the distinctive burn scar on the left side of his face from his eyebrow to his cheek,
        <br />
        <br />
        which was given to him by his father, Fire Lord Ozai,
        <br />
        <br />
        shortly before his banishment as a result of an incident in which he unintentionally disrespected his father by speaking out of turn and refusing to duel him.
        <br />
        <br />
        With support from his paternal uncle,
        <br />
        <br />
        General Iroh, and after much internal struggle and turmoil,
        <br />
        <br />
        Zuko rejected Ozai and his model of the Fire Nation.
        <br />
        <br />
        He instead joined the Avatar's group to become Aang's lifelong friend and firebending mentor and was determined to end the war and restore both his and the Fire Nation's honor.
        <br />
        <br />
        While Aang defeated Ozai, Zuko, with the help of Katara, defeated his younger sister, Princess Azula,
        <br />
        <br />
        and took his place as Fire Lord, declaring the end of the Hundred Year War and the start of an era of love and peace.
