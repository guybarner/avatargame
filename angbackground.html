        Aang was a male Air Nomad born in 12 BG and the Avatar during the century-long conflict known as the Hundred Year War.
        <br />
        <br />
        His immediate predecessor was Avatar Roku,and his immediate successor is Avatar Korra.
        <br />
        <br />
        As the Avatar of his time,
        <br />
        <br />
        he was the only person capable of using all four bending arts: airbending, waterbending, earthbending, and firebending.
        <br />
        <br />
        He was also one of a select few Avatars, and one of the first in many cycles to learn the ancient art of energybending,
        <br />
        <br />
        and the first Avatar known to have actively used the technique.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shortly before the beginning of the Hundred Year War,
        <br />
        <br />
        Aang was frozen in an iceberg for a hundred years; he later emerged, still biologically twelve years old,
        <br />
        <br />
        into a world engulfed by war.
        <br />
        <br />
        During his absence, the Fire Nation had waged war upon the other nations and managed to completely wipe out the pacifistic Air Nomads.
        <br />
        <br />
        It fell to Aang, the Avatar and the last airbender, to end the War by mastering the other three elements and defeating Fire Lord Ozai.
        <br />
        <br />
        He remained a kind and goofy kid at heart throughout his year-long struggle,
        <br />
        <br />
        despite the overwhelming loss of his people and the heavy burdens he was forced to bear.
        <br />
        <br />
        After his victory over the Phoenix King, Aang began a romantic relationship with his close friend, Katara.
        <br />
        <br />
        The couple eventually married and raised a family of three children: Bumi, a nonbender who became an airbender later in life,
        <br />
        <br />
        Kya, a waterbender, and the youngest, Tenzin, an airbender.
